Create a batch script with the following code:


openssl genrsa 2048 >my.key
openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key my.key -out APT<FacilityNumber>.<ClientShortname>.crt -subj "/CN=APT<FacilityNumber>.<ClientShortname>" -sha256 -config openssl.cfg -extensions v3_req
openssl pkcs12 -export -out APT<FacilityNumber>.<ClientShortname>.pfx -inkey my.key -in APT<FacilityNumber>.<ClientShortname>.crt -name "APT<FacilityNumber>.<ClientShortname>" -passout pass:
pause


1. Replace <FacilityNumber> with 7-digit facility number and <ClientShortname> with client abbreviation from Main Menu/Interfaces/AC in all occurrences.
2. Run the script. 
3. Copy the created .crt and .pfx files to this folder.
4. Upload the created .crt to DAU exchange folder
5. On your DAU, under Main Menu/Interfaces/AC/ select your client and go to edit/Read Certificate and load it from exchange.
